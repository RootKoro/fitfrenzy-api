Each component must have an explicite name written in the following format `component-name.jsx`.

    user-table.jsx
    user-item.jsx
    user-list.jsx
    user-column.jsx

### Rule 2

Each component must be written with a react function component (download for vscode the react extension named `simple react snippets` and in the file just write `ffc` and tabulate).

### Rule 3

While more than one component are using the same kind of code, you must made them only one modulable component
