# Page editing rules

### Rule 1

Each page must have an explicite name written in the following format `pagename.page.jsx`.

    index.page.jsx
    welcome.page.jsx
    home.page.jsx

### Rule 2

You should try to write your page files file a react function component (download for vscode the react extension named `simple react snippets` and in the file just write `cc` and tabulate).

Other possibility, download the extension Simple React Snippets and write `rnfes` and tabulate

### Rule 3

While more than one page is using the same kind of code, you must remove if it and create a new modulable component (cf. fitfrenzy-1.0/components/README.md)

### Advices

Try your best to not reache the 300 lines in each file.
